## POC ( Apollo Country Picker )

This is a proof of concept on how to apollo to fetch data from a grapqhl endpoint, incorporate with Context to preserve the current selected country on different views.

Possible todos:
- Create the same exact view but with the use of purely client cache using the @client directive
- Remove directive, using @client put a removed flag to track the removed items from the list.
